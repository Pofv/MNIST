# MNIST

Goal: Create a model that recognizes images of numbers 0-9. <br/>

MNIST1 is first used to create 540,000 extra images with elastic distortion. <br/>
MNIST2 is a pure numpy implementation of a 2 layer neural network, the model trained had an accuracy of 96.66% accuracy on test data. <br/>
MNIST3 uses tensorflow.keras and implements a CNN, accuracy of 99.59%. (saved in the h5 file) <br/>
